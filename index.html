    <h1>Presentations and Feedback</h1>
    <h3>Lindsey Murrell</h3>
    <p class="essay">A very important thing that we did not cover throughout the course of this class is the art of presenting creative work and giving feedback. 
        This topic covers two sides of a similar coin. On one side, presenting your work involves explaining your design and the process behind it to a client or some other audience. 
        On the other, giving feedback is all about helping someone else better their work or their process. In both situations, the focus is communication. 
        There are a lot of important aspects of design, but it would be pointless without good communication.</p>

    <h2>Presenting</h2>

    <p class="essay">Giving presentations is an important skill for all designers to have. 
        Bad presentations can lead the client to be confused, thus making them provide feedback that won’t benefit the designer. 
        A good presentation, on the other hand, will make the client more confident in who they hired to work for them. </p>

    <p class="essay">There are many aspects of presenting that should be noted: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>It is important for a designer to present their work in the best possible light, putting any markups they have onto images of the screens they are meant for. </li>
            <li>Keeping the slides clean, concise, and well-designed will make the presentation flow smoothly. </li>
            <li>Having one point per slide will keep the client’s attention, as well as keeping them on the same page as you present. </li>
            <li>Communicate the story behind the design, the goals of the design, the types of feedback needed, and the objectives of the meeting. </li>
            <li>Maintaining a good pace for the presentation will keep the audience attentive without confusing them by moving too quickly.</li>
        </ul>

    <p class="essay">The most important part of giving a presentation is being enthusiastic and confident. 
        Being confident in your work will make the client confident in who they hired!</p>

    <h2>Giving Feedback</h2>

    <p class="essay">On the other side of this communication is giving feedback. In a presentation, the designer points out what kind of feedback they are looking for. 
        When giving feedback, it is important to keep this focus and maintain a balance between positive and negative notes. </p>

    <p class="essay" id="negativityeffect">Negative information sticks more than positive information does. 
        This is known as the <strong>Negativity Effect</strong>.</p> 

    <p class="essay">To avoid having someone shrink away from your feedback, it is important to strike a balance, both in your feedback and in your relationship to the person. 
        If you are always giving criticism, they are going to become closed off. 
        If you are always being overly positive, any critique you do provide will catch them off guard, and they’ll be less likely to respond well to it.</p>

    <p class="essay">To balance the feedback you give, make sure you have equal amounts of positive and negative feedback. 
        Nobody wants to hear one positive note followed by five negative comments. 
        Try to keep them as even as possible. Beyond just the number, make sure your positive feedback has just as much detail as the negative. 
        Put the same amount of thought into both the good and the bad things you would like to say. 
        Otherwise, the negativity will still outweigh the positivity, no matter how many points you have on either side. </p>

    <p class="essay">Finally, make sure the techniques you use for giving feedback are habitual. 
        Don’t simply do something when you want to have a certain effect. 
        If you don’t make your techniques habit, you won’t become skillful at them.</p>

    <p class="essay">Communication in design is very important. It’s the entire purpose of creating designs. 
        They are meant to be usable and to communicate information. Because of this, it is also important to communicate well throughout the process of designing. 
        It is a skill that takes practice, but it’s one that should never be overlooked. </p>
